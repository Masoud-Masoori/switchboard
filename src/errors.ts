/**
 * Switchboard error taxonomy.
 *
 * Every governed failure carries a stable `SB_*` code plus a one-line, actionable hint — so an
 * agent (or a human reading the Logs page) gets a fixable message instead of an opaque stack.
 * This mirrors Composio's namespaced-code + possible-fixes idea, deliberately kept minimal and
 * dependency-free. Codes are also written to the audit row (`error_code`) for after-the-fact triage.
