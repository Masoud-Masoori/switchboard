/**
 * Outbound webhook delivery for policy decisions.
 *
 * When `settings.webhook` is enabled, every governed tool-call verdict whose decision is in
 * the configured `events` list is POSTed to the operator's URL as a slim JSON event. Delivery
 * is FIRE-AND-FORGET and FAIL-OPEN by construction: a webhook that is slow, down, or
 * misconfigured must never block, delay, or alter a governance decision — the decision is
 * already made and audited before we notify.
 *
 * The payload carries decision metadata only (server, tool, scope, decision, reason, timing) —
 * never the call's arguments or the upstream response. So enabling a webhook can never quietly
 * become an I/O exfiltration channel, even when `settings.logs.capture_io` is on.
 *
 * When `secret_ref` resolves to a vault secret, each delivery is signed with an
 * `x-switchboard-signature: sha256=<hmac>` header (the same scheme as the Settings page's
 * "send test event" button) so the receiver can authenticate it. If a `secret_ref` is
 * configured but cannot be resolved we DROP the delivery rather than send an unsigned event a
 * receiver would (rightly) reject — fail-closed on authenticity, still fail-open on the
 * governance decision itself.
