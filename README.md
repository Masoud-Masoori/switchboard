## The 30-second pitch

You have N agents (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, your own agents) and M apps
(GitHub, Notion, Slack, Gmail, an internal API). Wiring that up today is **N×M** pain: every
client configures every server by hand, and the "easy" hosted shortcut means **your OAuth
tokens live on someone else's server**.

Switchboard collapses **N×M into N×1**. You run one local process. A **dashboard** lets you
toggle apps **ON/OFF** and set each to **read / write / full**. Agents connect to **one MCP
endpoint** and see only what you allowed. Your credentials sit in a **local encrypted vault** —
there is no cloud, because there is no "us".

```
   Claude ─┐                          ┌─ github   (write,  delete_repo blocked)
   Cursor ─┼──▶  SWITCHBOARD  ──▶─────┼─ notion   (read)
   agents ─┘   one MCP endpoint       ├─ slack    (OFF)
              + policy + vault        └─ everything (read, approval-gated)
```

## Why it's different

|  | Switchboard | Hosted tool routers |
|---|---|---|
| **Where your tokens live** | A local AES-256 vault on **your** machine | Their cloud |
| **Integrations** | **Mounts existing MCP servers** — no treadmill | Hand-built, must be maintained |
| **Governance** | Per-tool `read/write/full` + approval gates + audit log | Usually all-or-nothing |
| **Context blow-up** | `search` mode → 2 meta-tools no matter how many servers | Dump every tool into context |
| **Cost** | Free, Apache-2.0, self-hosted | Metered SaaS |

The catalog is **not** the moat — hosted players already have bigger ones. The defensible
combination is **local credentials + a governance layer + a usable dashboard**, built as an
**aggregator** that rides the existing MCP ecosystem instead of re-implementing it.

## Quickstart

> Requires Node ≥ 18.18. Not yet on npm — run it from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Masoud-Masoori/switchboard.git
cd switchboard
npm install
npm run build

# scaffold a config + the ~/.switchboard home directory
node dist/cli.js init

# mount everything and print the governed tool list (no credentials needed —
# the bundled @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything is a real test server)
node dist/cli.js list

# run it: stdio for local clients + an HTTP endpoint & dashboard
node dist/cli.js serve
```

Open the dashboard at **http://127.0.0.1:8088**, then point an agent at the MCP endpoint:

```bash
# Claude Code / Claude Desktop, stdio transport:
claude mcp add switchboard -- node /absolute/path/to/switchboard/dist/cli.js serve

# or the Streamable HTTP endpoint, for any HTTP MCP client:
#   http://127.0.0.1:8088/mcp
```

### Storing a secret (BYO keys)

Secrets never appear in your config — the config holds only `${vault:name}` **references**.

```bash
# pipe the value in so it stays out of your shell history
printf '%s' 'ghp_xxx' | node dist/cli.js vault set github_pat
node dist/cli.js vault list      # names only, never values
```

```yaml
# switchboard.config.yaml
servers:
  - id: github
    source: npx
    package: "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
    enabled: true
    policy: write
    credentials:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${vault:github_pat}   # resolved locally at mount time
    tools:
      delete_repo: { enabled: false }     # hard-block the destructive one
```

### Connecting an OAuth provider (Phase 3)

For the five managed providers you don't paste a token — you authorize once and Switchboard seals
the result in the vault. Store the provider's client credentials, then run the loopback flow:

```bash
# one-time: store the OAuth app's client id/secret (names are a fixed convention)
printf '%s' '<client-id>'     | node dist/cli.js vault set oauth_github_client_id
printf '%s' '<client-secret>' | node dist/cli.js vault set oauth_github_client_secret

node dist/cli.js catalog            # see provider status: ready / needs client id / connected
node dist/cli.js connect github     # prints an authorize URL, waits on a local loopback callback
```

Or click **Connect** in the dashboard's catalog card. The browser bounces through the provider and
back to `127.0.0.1`, the token is sealed, and the row flips to **connected** — no token ever leaves
your machine.

### Wrapping a REST API as MCP (app2mcp, Phase 4)

Point a server at an OpenAPI/Swagger spec and Switchboard generates the MCP tools in-process at mount:

```yaml
servers:
  - id: petstore
    source: app2mcp
    openapi: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
    base_url: https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3   # override for relative/host-less specs
    policy: read                                     # ceiling: GET tools allowed, DELETE denied
    credentials:
      Authorization: ${vault:petstore_token}         # resolved per call from the vault
```

Each operation becomes a governed tool. Scope is inferred from the HTTP verb
(`GET`→read, `POST/PUT/PATCH`→write, `DELETE`→full), so a generated `deletepet` is **denied** under the
`read` ceiling above — same policy engine as every other server.

## CLI

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `switchboard init` | Scaffold `switchboard.config.yaml` + the `~/.switchboard` home |
| `switchboard serve` | Run the gateway (stdio and/or HTTP, per config) |
| `switchboard dashboard` | Run only the HTTP endpoint + web console |
| `switchboard list` | Mount everything and print the governed tool list, then exit |
| `switchboard doctor` | Check Node, config, transports, and that every secret resolves |
| `switchboard catalog` | List the OAuth providers and their connection status |
| `switchboard connect <provider>` | Authorize a provider locally (loopback OAuth → token sealed in the vault) |
| `switchboard vault set\|list\|rm <name>` | Manage locally-stored secrets |

Global flag: `-c, --config <path>` (default `switchboard.config.yaml`).
Once built and linked (`npm link`), the `switchboard` command replaces `node dist/cli.js`.

## How it works

```
   agent clients ──MCP──▶  GATEWAY  ──▶  ROUTER ──▶ POLICY ENGINE ──▶ REGISTRY ──▶ upstream
   (stdio + HTTP)          one server     namespaced/    read<write<     mounted     MCP servers
                                          flat/search    full + gates    clients     (npx / remote)
                                              │              │              ▲
                                          DASHBOARD       AUDIT LOG       VAULT
                                          (toggle/scope)  (append-only)   (AES-256-GCM, local)
```

Every call is classified (`read`/`write`/`full`), checked against the server's scope ceiling and
any per-tool override, optionally held for human approval, then forwarded — and **every verdict is
written to an append-only audit log**. Full walkthrough in **[docs/BLUEPRINT.md](docs/BLUEPRINT.md)**.

### Tool-exposure modes

Mount 30 servers and naive aggregation dumps ~600 tool schemas into your agent's context — accuracy
collapses, tokens explode. Switchboard offers three modes via `gateway.tool_exposure`:

- **`namespaced`** (default) — tools prefixed `github__create_issue`; only enabled servers exposed.
- **`flat`** — bare tool names (small setups; first server to claim a name wins).
- **`search`** — expose just two meta-tools, **`find_tools(query)`** and **`call_tool(name,args)`**.
  The agent searches; Switchboard returns only the relevant handful. The surface stays flat no
  matter how many servers you mount.

## Project status

**Working alpha — all five phases shipped.** Real and verified today: the aggregating gateway
(stdio + Streamable HTTP), the policy engine, all three tool-exposure modes, the encrypted vault, the
approval gate, the audit log, the dashboard, and the CLI. The full `find_tools → call_tool` round-trip
works end-to-end through the governed path.

- **Managed OAuth (Phase 3)** — local OAuth for **5 providers** (Google, GitHub, Slack, Notion, Linear)
  via the catalog UI or `switchboard connect <provider>`; tokens are sealed in the same local vault as
  BYO keys. Hand-rolled on Node `crypto` — no third-party auth service, zero native deps.
- **app2mcp (Phase 4)** — point `source: app2mcp` at an OpenAPI/Swagger spec and Switchboard generates
  an in-process MCP server at mount, with verb→scope inference flowing into the **same** governance
  engine (a generated `deletepet` is denied under a `read` ceiling). A reference without a resolvable
  spec still fails closed.

See **[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)** for the phase-by-phase detail.

## Security

- Credentials live only in `~/.switchboard/vault.json`, **AES-256-GCM** encrypted with a key in
  `~/.switchboard/vault.key`. Nothing is transmitted off the machine; the vault makes no network calls.
- The HTTP endpoint binds to **127.0.0.1** by default — local-first, not exposed to the network.
- Governance **fails closed**: a disabled server, an over-ceiling scope, or an unverifiable approval
  context all result in *deny*, not a silent allow.
